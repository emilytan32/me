I learned the differences between the following brackets:
    () Round brackets: Used to call functions, define tuples, wrap line breaks, and define function arguments.
    []Square brackets: Used to define lists and index into all collections.
    {} Curly braces: Used to define dictionaries and sets.
I also gained an understanding of lists, dictionaries, and tuples:
    List: A list is a collection of items that can be of different types.
    Dictionary: A dictionary is a collection of key-value pairs, with each value associated with a unique key.
    Tuple: A tuple is an ordered collection of items that can contain elements of different types.
there's the 'another_list' variable, which is a list containing the previously defined variables as its elements.

I then began working on the exercises from Set 2. Exercise 3 was notably trickier thann excersise 1, as I needed to approach the questions from a different perspective than I'm used to. The answers were presented in the form of general formulas rather than specific numbers or statements. Initially, it was challenging to adjust my thinking, but I'm gradually training myself to tackle questions in this way.
