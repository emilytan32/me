TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.
Set 2, excersize 3 was definitely more tricky than Set 1 as I had to try and look at the questions differently than I would normally. The answers were in the form of general formulas, not specific numbers or statements. It was hard to wrap my head around it at first, but I am starting to train myself to attempt questions in that way.
