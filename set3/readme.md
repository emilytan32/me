TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.
I actualy found excersize 3 in this set fun, i just struggled a bit with how to incorporate ⬇️
    "except ValueError:
            print("Invalid input. Please enter a valid number.")"
because I wasnt sure where to fit it in the code but I worked it out as it went at the end of each loop.
