TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.
I actualy found excersize 3 in this set fun as i struggled a bit with how to incorporate ⬇️
    "except ValueError:
            print("Invalid input. Please enter a valid number.")"
but with much trial and error and a little help from chat GPT i got it and i felt accomplished.
