I learned about algorithms this week. In Exercise 1, I gained an understanding of the following concepts:
    Creating lists of numbers using loops and ranges.
    Developing functions that handle user input validation, including handling ranges and data types.
    Combining different techniques to create more robust input handling functions.
Exercise 2 was an enjoyable game that I found quite interesting. However, I did face some challenges in determining when to use 'while', 'if', 'elif', and 'else', especially when creating my own guessing game in Exercise 3.

key notes:- 

    while: The 'while' loop is used to repeatedly execute a block of code as long as a specified condition is true. It's useful for tasks that need to be repeated a certain number of times, based on a condition.

    if: The 'if' statement is used to execute a block of code if a specified condition is true. It's a fundamental way of making decisions based on conditions in programming.

    elif: The 'elif' statement is used to check additional conditions if the preceding 'if' or 'elif' conditions are not met. It's handy when you have multiple conditions to check in sequence.

    else: The 'else' statement is used to execute a block of code when the 'if' condition is not met or false. It provides an alternative action when the condition isn't satisfied.

In Exercise 4, I created my first algorithm. While working on it, I learned about the binary search algorithm, which is a method for finding the position of a target value. During this process, I also implemented algorithms in code. I developed a function that performs binary search to find a specified 'actual_number' within a given range ('low' to 'high'). To track my guesses, I used the 'tries' variable. Throughout this process, I gained valuable experience in debugging using tools while solving problems.

Additionally, I encountered a challenge when incorporating the code:
    "except ValueError:
        print("Invalid input. Please enter a valid number.")
I initially struggled with figuring out where to place it, but I eventually determined that it should be positioned at the end of each loop.
