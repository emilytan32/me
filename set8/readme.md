This week, there was a test that I was content with overall. However, one of the questions that left me puzzled was the one involving the "def pet_filter(letter="a")" code. The answer I came to was filtered = [pet for pet in pets if letter in pet], and the return statement follows as return filtered. This answer appeared to be a rather verbose list comprehension solution, which took some time for me to fully comprehend. Eventually, I arrived at the realization that the code essentially filters pet names by checking if the specified letter is present within each pet's name. If the letter is found, that pet's name is added to the filtered list."
