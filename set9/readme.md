data project:
This week, I discovered numerous interesting things in my data project. One notable finding was that New York has the highest number of ski resorts in the US. This discovery is intriguing because New York doesn't possess a very high vertical, unlike Colorado. I would have expected Colorado to boast the most ski resorts due to its substantial vertical. However, I concluded that New York harbors numerous smaller resorts. I made a pie chart of the amount of resorts in the us using the type = 'Pie'.
