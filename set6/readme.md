data project:
I began exploring potential data projects that piqued my interest. Initially, I considered examining car charging stations in NSW, but the dataset turned out to be less engaging and lacked intriguing aspects. As one of my hobbies is skiing, I turned my attention to datasets related to snow. Delving into various dimensions of snow-related data, I ultimately settled on a dataset that compares different ski resorts.
